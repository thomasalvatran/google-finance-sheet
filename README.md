This is short project to create a dynamic sheet to store the stocks symbol and change according to current price, closed price and open price. Finally find the lowest price in the last 3 months with the date. It is using google financing function GOOOLEFINANCING togther with javacript for parse date from yahoo to get the lowest of the price during the day not the closed price. With the help of AI ChatGPT on the Javascript. I retire 2 years my coding is rusty I did not do a lot of Javascript but C/C++ and PHP/Python with MySQL that the laguages I worked. Only a few functions of JS is using need to check on Work Sheet go to the cell double click to see which JS has been using for each cell. e.i =getTSLAMin3MonthsYahooLow(A2) A2 is cell number passing to JS function called getTSLAMin3MonthsYahooLow the data is from Yahoo Financing since Google only find the data in the sheet only we need to parse the data from outside such as Yahoo financing so we do not need to create the data in the working sheet must easy clean and simple otherwise the sheet will be very big with all the data from 3 months time. Please note Yahoo only provide the date in 1 hr time frame it does not create 1m or 5m time frame as the technical analyses that we see in the tradingview because if yahoo does every 1m the data will be huge when parse to Google Sheet see eexaple
